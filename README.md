## Overview

This project implements a generic planning algorithm that computes a **safe path** through a finite set of states `S = {s1, s2, ..., sn}` embedded in `ℝᵈ`. Every state is a vector, every transition between states carries a **cost**, **safety score**, **reliability**, and **availability flag**, and a subset of states is marked as **bad** and must never be visited.

The planner is built around **D\* Lite**, an incremental heuristic search algorithm, so that when the environment changes — the goal moves, bad states change, transitions are disabled/added — the planner can **reuse prior search effort** instead of re-solving the problem from scratch.

Although inspired by AI planning, the emphasis of this project is on:

- Graph search (D\* Lite)
- Heuristic design
- Multi-objective optimization (cost, safety, reliability)
- Software engineering (clean interfaces, incremental updates)
- Experimental evaluation

## Problem Definition

| Assignment Concept | Implementation |
|---|---|
| State `si = (x1, ..., xd)` | `State` — has an `id`, `name`, and `embedding` (coordinate vector) |
| Transition `(si, sj)` | `Transition` — has `id`, `from_state`, `to_state`, `cost`, `safety`, `reliability`, `available` |
| Bad states `B` | `PlanningProblem.bad_states` — a set of state IDs the planner must never enter |
| Initial / goal state | `PlanningProblem.initial_state` / `PlanningProblem.goal_state` |
| Planner interface | `DStarLite.plan()` / `DStarLite.replan()` returning a `PlanningResult` |

### Objective Function

The planner scores paths using a weighted combination of the assignment's objective function:

```
Score(P) = α·G − β·C + γ·D + δ·R
```

where `G` is goal completion, `C` is cumulative transition cost, `D` is the minimum safety distance to any bad state, and `R` is cumulative reliability. In this implementation, the trade-off between cost, safety, and reliability is exposed directly as tunable **weights** (`cost_weight`, `safety_weight`, `reliability_weight`) in both the planner constructor and the Streamlit sidebar, so a user can shift the planner from "cheapest path" toward "safest path" interactively.

## Features

- D\* Lite based incremental path planning
- Finite Cartesian state-space representation
- Transition cost optimization
- Safety-aware planning (maximizes minimum distance to bad states)
- Reliability-aware planning
- Hard avoidance of bad states
- Dynamic transition disabling / enabling
- Dynamic transition addition
- Dynamic goal updates
- Dynamic bad-state updates
- Incremental replanning (no full graph rebuild)
- Interactive Streamlit visualization of the state space and selected path
- Automated experimental benchmark suite covering all six assignment test cases
- Planning/replanning performance measurement (time, explored states)

## Algorithm: D\* Lite

D\* Lite was chosen over LPA\* because the assignment's dynamic-environment requirements (moving goal, changing bad states, transitions appearing/disappearing) map directly onto D\* Lite's core strength: it searches **backward from the goal** and maintains `g` and `rhs` values for every state so that, after a local change, only the affected region of the search needs to be repaired via a priority queue of inconsistent states, instead of re-running search over the whole graph.

**Key design choices:**

1. **State representation** — Each `State` stores an integer `id`, a human-readable `name`, and a `d`-dimensional `embedding` used both for the heuristic and for visualization.
2. **Heuristic function** — Euclidean distance between state embeddings, `h(s, goal) = ||embedding(s) − embedding(goal)||₂`, which is admissible and consistent for the Cartesian metric space used here.
3. **Safety computation** — For every candidate state, the minimum Euclidean distance to any bad state is computed and folded into the transition's `safety` score; the planner's `safety_weight` trades this off against raw path cost.
4. **Edge cost** — A weighted combination of a transition's `cost`, its `(1 − safety)` penalty, and its `(1 − reliability)` penalty, scaled by `cost_weight`, `safety_weight`, and `reliability_weight` respectively. Unavailable transitions are treated as having infinite cost and are never traversed.
5. **Data structures** — A priority queue (min-heap) keyed by the D\* Lite key function `[min(g, rhs) + h, min(g, rhs)]`, plus hash maps for `g`-values, `rhs`-values, states, and transitions for O(1) lookup during updates.
6. **Incremental replanning** — `update_goal()`, `update_bad_states()`, `update_transition()`, and `add_transition()` each locally mark the affected states as inconsistent and push them back onto the priority queue; `replan()` then only re-expands the states whose values actually changed, rather than restarting the search.

## Interactive Streamlit App

The app lets you:

1. Select one of the six assignment test cases.
2. Tune the cost / safety / reliability weights.
3. Run the planner and view the resulting path overlaid on the Cartesian state-space graph.
4. Disable existing transitions, add new ones, change the goal state, or change the set of bad states — all from the sidebar.
5. Trigger **Incremental Replan** to update the existing D\* Lite search instead of rebuilding it.
6. Inspect planning statistics: total cost, minimum safety distance, reliability, explored states, planning time, and replanning time.
7. Run the full experimental evaluation across all test cases with one click.

In the graph view: the **initial state** is blue, the **goal state** is gold, **bad states** are red, and the **selected path** is highlighted in green.

## Test Cases

| # | Test Case | What It Verifies |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Basic Reachability | Planner returns the unique valid path `S → A → B → G` |
| 2 | Bad State Avoidance | Planner rejects `S → A → X → G` (X is bad) and selects `S → C → D → G` |
| 3 | Safety Margin | Planner balances a cheaper-but-riskier path against a costlier-but-safer one, controlled by the safety weight |
| 4 | Dynamic Transition | When `(A, G)` becomes unavailable mid-run, the planner finds an alternative route |
| 5 | Goal Update | When the goal changes, the planner revises the path via incremental replanning rather than a full rebuild |
| 6 | Transition Addition | A newly inserted shortcut transition is discovered and used if it improves the solution |

## Experimental Evaluation

`experiments/benchmark.py` runs all six test cases and records, for each:

- Goal success rate
- Number of bad states visited (expected: zero)
- Total path cost
- Minimum distance to bad states (safety margin)
- Cumulative reliability
- Number of explored states
- Planning time (ms)
- Replanning time (ms), where applicable

These results are viewable either by running the benchmark script directly or via the **"Run All Experiments"** button in the Streamlit app.

## Dynamic Replanning

The assignment requires the planner to handle a changing environment efficiently:

| Environment Change | Planner Response |
|---|---|
| Goal state changes | `DStarLite.update_goal(new_goal)` re-keys the priority queue relative to the new goal and reuses existing `g`/`rhs` values elsewhere in the graph |
| Bad states change | `DStarLite.update_bad_states(new_bad_states)` recomputes safety penalties only for affected transitions |
| Transition becomes unavailable/available | `DStarLite.update_transition(id, available)` marks affected states inconsistent |
| New transition added | `DStarLite.add_transition(transition)` inserts the edge and re-evaluates only the states it touches |

After any of the above, calling `planner.replan()` repairs the search incrementally rather than calling `plan()` again from scratch — this is the central advantage of D\* Lite over a plain Dijkstra/A\* re-run on every update.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time complexity:** Each priority-queue operation (insert/update/pop) costs `O(log n)` for `n` states. A full initial computation is `O(E log n)` for `E` transitions. An incremental update after a local change (goal move, single transition toggle, single bad-state change) only re-expands the states whose `g`/`rhs` values become inconsistent, which in practice is a small local neighborhood rather than the whole graph — asymptotically bounded by `O(k log n)` where `k` is the number of affected states, `k ≪ n` for local changes.
- **Space complexity:** `O(n + E)` — one `g` and `rhs` value per state, plus storage for all states and transitions, plus the priority queue which holds at most `n` entries.

##  Planning Approach

The system uses the **D* Lite** algorithm to find paths from an initial state to a goal state.

Each transition contains information about:

- Cost
- Safety
- Reliability
- Availability

The planner considers these properties when selecting a path.

States can also be marked as **bad states**. The planner avoids these states when searching for a safe route.

The main advantage of D* Lite is its ability to handle changes in the environment efficiently.

When a transition, goal, or other planning condition changes, the planner can update the existing search and perform **incremental replanning** rather than starting the entire search from scratch.
